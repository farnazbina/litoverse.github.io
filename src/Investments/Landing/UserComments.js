            For me, the biggest advantage is that I can get my funds back any
            time. I've lost a lot of crypto investments in the past because I
            couldn't withdraw them. With USDN, I first staked a small amount and
            then withdrew it. When I saw that it worked, I staked a bigger
            amount. Too many people are chasing high interest rates, but the
            really important thing is to have access to your funds when you need
            it. USDN lets you withdraw without penalties, whenever you want, and
            that's great. My only complaint is that the bank card tool with
            AdvCash doesn't accept cards from my country. I had to buy BTC on a
            different site, then transfer it to Waves.Exchange and convert it to
            USDN.
